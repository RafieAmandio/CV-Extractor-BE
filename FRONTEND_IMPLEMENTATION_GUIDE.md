# CV Data Extractor - Frontend Implementation Guide

This document outlines the key frontend features and implementation details for the CV Data Extractor application.

## Overview

The frontend should provide an intuitive interface for:
1. Uploading and parsing CVs
2. Viewing and managing extracted CV data
3. Creating and managing job listings
4. Matching CVs to jobs and vice versa

## Core Features

### 1. CV Management

*Current Status: Basic CV upload and viewing implemented*

#### Enhancements Needed:
- Add a dashboard view showing all CVs with search and filter capabilities
- Implement pagination controls for CV listing
- Create a detailed CV view page with properly formatted sections
- Add inline editing capabilities for CV fields
- Create a CV comparison feature to compare multiple candidates

### 2. Job Management

*Current Status: Not implemented*

#### Implementation Needed:
- Create a job listing page with search, filter, and sort capabilities
- Build a job creation form with validation
- Implement job editing and deletion functionality
- Design a detailed job view page
- Add a dashboard for tracking job metrics

### 3. Matching Interface

*Current Status: Not implemented*

#### Implementation Needed:
- Create a match results page showing compatibility scores
- Build a detailed match view that explains why a CV matches a job
- Implement a match dashboard showing top candidates for each job
- Add a candidate-to-job matching view
- Create visualizations for match scores and criteria
- Implement match caching indicators (showing if results are from cache)
- Add a "refresh" button for recalculating matches when needed

## API Integration

### CV Endpoints

These endpoints are already integrated:
- `POST /api/cv/extract` - Upload and extract CV data
- `GET /api/cv` - List all CVs with pagination
- `GET /api/cv/:id` - Get a specific CV

These endpoints need integration:
- `GET /api/cv/ids` - Get all CV IDs
- `GET /api/cv/:id/jobs?limit=10&refresh=false` - Find best matching jobs for a CV

### Job Endpoints

All job endpoints need integration:
- `POST /api/jobs/seed` - Seed the database with sample jobs
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create a new job
- `GET /api/jobs` - List all jobs with pagination
- `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Get a specific job
- `PUT /api/jobs/:id` - Update a job
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` - Delete a job
- `GET /api/jobs/:id/matches?limit=10&refresh=false` - Find best matching CVs for a job

## UI/UX Recommendations

### 1. Dashboard Layout
- Create a main dashboard with key metrics and quick access to recent CVs and jobs
- Use cards for CV and job listings with clear visual indicators
- Implement a responsive design for mobile and desktop users

### 2. CV/Job Views
- Display CV data in clearly defined sections (Personal Info, Experience, Education, etc.)
- Use visual indicators for match quality (color coding, percentage bars)
- Implement a split view for comparing a CV against a job

### 3. Match Visualization
- Create visual representations of match scores (charts, graphs)
- Highlight matching skills and experience
- Use color coding to indicate match strength (red/yellow/green)
- Show clear indicators when using cached matches vs. fresh calculations

### 4. User Interactions
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for CV uploads
- Implement auto-save for form fields
- Use progressive loading for CV and job lists
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Implementation Considerations

### Caching
- Display indicators when showing cached match results
- Provide an option to force recalculation with the `refresh=true` parameter
- Show timestamp of when matches were last calculated

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Performance
- Implement lazy loading for CV and job lists
- Use virtual scrolling for long lists
- Cache API responses where appropriate
- Optimize images and assets

## Technology Recommendations

- **Framework**: React or Vue.js for component-based architecture
- **State Management**: Redux or Vuex for managing application state
- **UI Components**: Material-UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or D3.js for match score visualizations
- **Form Handling**: Formik or React Hook Form with Yup validation

## Next Steps

1. Set up the basic project structure with your chosen framework
2. Implement the core layouts and navigation
3. Begin with job management functionality since CV upload is already working
4. Integrate the matching endpoints and build the visualization components
5. Enhance the user experience with additional features and refinements
