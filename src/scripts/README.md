- Tracks processed CVs across batches
- Warns about skipped duplicates

### Batch Processing
- Processes CVs in configurable batches (default: 5)
- Includes progress tracking and logging
- Handles errors gracefully (continues on failure)
- Rate limiting to avoid API limits

### Rich Data Extraction

      "candidate": "Alice Johnson",
      "job": "Senior Software Engineer", 
      "score": 94.87
    }
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Job Definitions
Edit `job-definitions.json` to:
- Add new job roles
- Modify skill requirements
- Update experience thresholds
- Change education requirements

### Batch Size
Modify batch size in the script:
```javascript
const results = await this.processCVsInBatches(cvs, 10); // Increase batch size
```

### Output Directory
Change output location:
```javascript
this.outputDir = path.join(__dirname, '../output'); // Custom location
```

## üö® Requirements

- Node.js environment
- MongoDB connection
- OpenAI API key configured
- CVs uploaded to database

## ‚ö° Performance

- **Processing Speed**: ~5 CVs per batch with 1s delays
- **API Efficiency**: 6x fewer API calls vs individual job scoring
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with field selection and batching
- **Error Handling**: Continues processing on individual failures

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No CVs found**
```bash
‚ùå No CVs found in database. Please upload some CVs first.
```
Solution: Upload CVs using the upload API endpoint

**API Rate Limits**
```bash
Error: Rate limit exceeded
```
Solution: Increase delay between batches or reduce batch size

**Missing Job Definitions**
```bash
Error: Cannot read job-definitions.json
```
Solution: Ensure `job-definitions.json` exists in scripts directory

### Logs
Check logs for detailed processing information:
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log
```

## üìù Example Usage

```bash
# Basic run
node score-all-cvs.js

# Check output
ls -la output/
cat output/cv-scores-2024-01-15T10-30-00.csv
```

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Talent Acquisition**: Score candidates for multiple roles
2. **Skills Gap Analysis**: Identify missing skills across roles
