**Query Parsing Examples:**

The system automatically extracts filters from natural language:

| Query | Extracted Filters | Semantic Terms |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| "Find UI graduates with GPA above 3.2 who worked at Traveloka" | university: "UI", gpa: ‚â•3.2, company: "Traveloka" | "graduates" |
| "Python developers with React experience from top universities" | skills: ["Python", "React"] | "developers", "top universities" |
| "Senior engineers with GPA above 3.5" | gpa: ‚â•3.5 | "senior engineers" |

**Example Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cv/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Find candidates from UI with GPA above 3.2 who worked at Traveloka",
    "cvId": "123456789"
  }'
```

**Available AI Functions:**
- `searchCVs`: Search for CVs based on specific criteria
- `getCVDetails`: Get detailed information about a specific CV
- `getJobMatches`: Get job matches for a specific CV

2. Function calls and their results are preserved in the history
3. The history endpoint supports flexible filtering and pagination
4. All dates should be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
5. The response includes basic CV information when available
6. The pagination object helps with implementing infinite scroll or pagination UI
